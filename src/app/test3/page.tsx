                    You can use your favorite UI framework to implement. Only criteria
                    is that you should use react. You will be assessed based on quality
                    of code, ability to think about and handle different user interaction 
                    scenarios and adherence to the design. * Implement only email and password fields along with
                    the submit button. Reference design - https://dribbble.com/shots/24121324-Sign-in-Login
